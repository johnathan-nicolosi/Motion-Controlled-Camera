<h1>Motion Controlled Camera</h1>
This project will use a series of motion detectors, connected to an Arduino Uno, to detect motion and steer a servo-controlled camera in the direction of motion. 

For this project, you will need an Arduino Uno and a Motor Shield, with three PIR sensors, a Raspberry Pi and Raspberry Pi camera, and a servo motor camera mount (with two servo motors).
